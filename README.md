This repository contains code for the PyData Amsterdam 2023 Workshop. 

To follow along fully, you'll want to download the GoEmotions data from [here](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/goemotions/data/full_dataset)
and then make sure the dependencies are installed. 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This repo will be updated such that you'll have access to the data that you've annotated yourself.
